# Error Categories

Errors in programming can be classified into three main types:

- Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language, such as missing punctuation or incorrect indentation.
- Runtime errors happen while the program is running and usually result in a crash, often due to issues like dividing by zero or using an undefined variable.
- Logic errors are mistakes in the program's design that cause incorrect results, even though the code runs without crashing.
