# Appendix

## Game Systems

### A
- **Accuracy**: A score based on correct lines minus errors (higher = better)
- **Achievements**: Unlockable rewards for completing challenges and mastering concepts
- **Allies**: NPCs that introduce new programming concepts and provide guidance
- **Analyzer**: A system that checks code syntax after 1.5 seconds of user inactivity
- **Authentication**: Secure player login/registration through Supabase

### B
- **Battle Boosters**: Power-ups that help during combat:
  - Player Resurrection: Revives player if defeated
  - Syntax Shield: Blocks damage from failed code runs

### C
- **Code-Window**: The main editor where tiles are connected to write code
- **Concept Mastery**: Tracks player proficiency in programming topics (Variables, If-statements, Loops, etc.)
- **Concept Proficiency**: Average skill in a specific programming concept, calculated from normalized scores
- **Cursor System**: Allows precise placement of tiles in the code window

### E
- **Efficiency**: Score based on enemy HP divided by tiles used (higher = better)
- **Enemies**: Opponents that represent coding challenges
- **Entities**: Interactive characters in the game (allies, enemies, bosses)
- **Exceptions**: Errors in code that trigger enemy attacks

### F
- **Fuzzy Finder**: A search system for quickly locating specific tiles
- **Feedback Systems**: Tools that help players learn:
  - Code Analysis: Real-time syntax checking
  - Help System: Hints and error messages
  - Real-Time Error Messages: Immediate feedback on incorrect syntax

### G
- **Global Leaderboard**: Overall ranking based on complete game progress
- **Grand Mastery**: Overall coding skill across all attempted concepts

### H
- **HP (Health Points)**: Player/enemy health (0 HP = level reset)
- **Help System**: Provides hints and error messages inspired by Rust's Error ID system

### L
- **Leaderboards**: Three types of rankings:
  - Level Leaderboards: Per-level performance
  - Concept Leaderboards: Programming topic mastery
  - Global Leaderboard: Overall coding skill
- **Level Types**:
  - Concept Scenarios: Teaching specific programming concepts
  - Practice Levels: Reinforcing learned concepts
  - Challenge Levels: Testing concept mastery
  - Story Levels: Contextualizing learning

### M
- **Mastery Scores**: Two types of mastery tracking:
  - Concept Proficiency: Average skill in a programming topic
  - Overall Mastery: Average of all concept proficiencies

### N
- **Normalized Scores**: Performance metrics scaled to 0-100:
  - Normalized Speed: Time comparison to world record
  - Normalized Accuracy: Comparison to perfect accuracy
  - Normalized Efficiency: Comparison to most efficient solution

### O
- **Output-Window**: Displays execution results, errors, and warnings
- **Overall Mastery**: Average of all Concept Proficiencies

### P
- **Player Profiles**: Tracks:
  - Achievements and milestones
  - Concept mastery
  - Rankings (level, concept, global)
  - Fastest level times
  - Total code written

### S
- **Speed**: Time taken to complete a level (lower = better)
- **Story Context**: Narrative framing for levels
- **Syntax Shield**: Booster that blocks damage from failed code runs

### T
- **Tile-Based System**:
  - Tile-Window: Panel displaying available code tiles
  - Tile Compression: Merges tiles for faster coding after concept mastery
  - Tile Mechanics: Progressive unlocking of tiles based on concepts
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Player acts first, then enemy responds

### V
- **Valid Code**: Correctly executed code that:
  - Damages enemies
  - Buffs the player
  - Solves puzzles
