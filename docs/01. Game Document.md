# Code Conquest: The Adventure Game

## Overview
Code Conquest is an educational game that teaches programming concepts through an engaging adventure format. Players learn to code by solving challenges and battling enemies using programming concepts.

## Core Game Systems

### 1. Tile-Based Coding System

#### Windows
- **Tile-Window**: A virtual keyboard containing available code tiles
- **Code-Window**: The main editor where tiles are connected to write code
- **Output-Window**: Displays execution results, errors, and warnings

#### Tile Mechanics
- **Progression System**
  - Each level provides a limited set of tiles based on current concepts
  - New programming concepts unlock related tiles
  - Unlocked tiles remain available throughout the game
  - Tiles are organized by programming concepts

- **Tile Structure**
  - Tiles are organized in a tree-based structure
  - Each node contains specific syntax elements (keywords, operators, string contents)
  - Nodes can be connected to form valid code sequences

- **Cursor System**
  - Similar to traditional code editors
  - Can be positioned in two ways:
    - Between connected nodes
    - Within a node (for editable elements like string contents)
  - Placement is done by clicking either:
    - A node
    - The connecting line between nodes

- **Tile Insertion**
  - Tiles from the Tile-Window are inserted at the cursor's position
  - Allows precise control over code composition
  - Maintains the tree structure while enabling flexible code writing

#### Search Functionality
- Implements a fuzzy finder for quick tile location
- Helps players find specific syntax elements easily
- Becomes more useful as more tiles are unlocked

### 2. Turn-Based Gameplay

#### Code Execution
- **Execution Flow**
  - Players click the **Run** button to execute connected tiles
  - Code is validated before execution
  - Results are displayed in the Output-Window

- **Execution Outcomes**
  - **Valid Code**
    - Triggers effects based on level scenario
    - Can damage enemies
    - Can buff the player
    - Can solve puzzles
  - **Invalid Code**
    - Results in enemy attacks
    - Provides learning opportunities
    - Shows error messages

#### Turn System
- Player always moves first
- Enemy responds after player's code execution
- Both player and enemy have health points (HP)
- Level resets if player's HP reaches 0

### 3. Level Design

#### Level Types
- **Concept Scenarios**: Structured sequences teaching specific programming concepts
- **Practice Levels**: Reinforce learned concepts
- **Challenge Levels**: Test concept mastery
- **Story Levels**: Contextualize learning in narrative

#### Level Structure
- **Story Context**: Sets the scene and objectives
- **Unique Challenges**: Specific to the concept being taught
- **Entities**: Enemies or allies that interact with the code

#### Concept Progression
- **Introduction**: Basic concept explanation
- **Practice**: Hands-on application
- **Variation**: Different use cases
- **Advanced Usage**: Complex applications
- **Mastery**: Complete understanding

### 4. Feedback Systems

#### Code Analysis
- Real-time syntax checking
- Analyzer runs after 1.5 seconds of user inactivity
- No automatic code modification

#### Help System
- **Hints & Tips**
  - Syntax error suggestions
  - Inspired by Rust's Error ID system
- **Real-Time Error Messages**
  - Immediate feedback during tile connections
  - Guides players toward correct syntax

### 5. Progression Features

#### Battle Boosters
- **Player Resurrection**: Revives player if defeated
- **Syntax Shield**: Blocks damage from failed code runs

#### Enhanced Coding
- **Tile Compression**: Unlocks after concept mastery
  - Combines related tiles into single units
  - Speeds up code writing
  - Example: `if __name__ == "__main__":` as one tile

### 6. Analytics and Tracking

#### Concept Mastery
- Tracks understanding of:
- Variables
- If-statements
- Loops
- Other core concepts
- Earns mastery through:
  - Correct usage
  - Challenge completion
  - Consistent performance

#### Level Progress
- Completed levels
- Encountered enemies
- Collected items
- Player-written code

### 7. Online Features (Supabase)
