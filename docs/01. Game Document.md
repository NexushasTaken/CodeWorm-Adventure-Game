# Code Conquest: The Adventure Game

## Overview

Code Conquest is an educational game that teaches programming concepts through an engaging adventure format. Players learn to code by solving challenges and battling enemies using programming concepts.

## Core Game Systems

### 1. Tile-Based Coding System

#### Windows

- **Tile-Window**: A virtual keyboard containing available code tiles
- **Code-Window**: The main editor where tiles are connected to write code
- **Output-Window**: Displays execution results, errors, and warnings

#### Tile Mechanics

- **Progression System**
  - Each level provides a limited set of tiles based on current concepts
  - New programming concepts unlock related tiles
  - Unlocked tiles remain available throughout the game
  - Tiles are organized by programming concepts

- **Tile Structure**
  - Tiles are organized in a tree-based structure
  - Each node contains specific syntax elements (keywords, operators, string contents)
  - Nodes can be connected to form valid code sequences

- **Cursor System**
  - Similar to traditional code editors
  - Can be positioned in two ways:
    - Between connected nodes
    - Within a node (for editable elements like string contents)
  - Placement is done by clicking either:
    - A node
    - The connecting line between nodes

- **Tile Insertion**
  - Tiles from the Tile-Window are inserted at the cursor's position
  - Allows precise control over code composition
  - Maintains the tree structure while enabling flexible code writing

#### Search Functionality

- Implements a fuzzy finder for quick tile location
- Helps players find specific syntax elements easily
- Becomes more useful as more tiles are unlocked

### 2. Turn-Based Gameplay

#### Code Execution

- **Execution Flow**
  - Players click the **Run** button to execute connected tiles
  - Code is validated before execution
  - Results are displayed in the Output-Window

- **Execution Outcomes**
  - **Valid Code**
    - Can damage enemies
    - Can solve puzzles
  - **Invalid Code**
    - Results in enemy attacks
    - Provides learning opportunities
    - Shows error messages

#### Turn System

- Player always moves first
- Enemy responds after player's code execution
- Both player and enemy have health points (HP)
- Level resets if player's HP reaches 0

### 3. Level Design

#### Concepts and Scenarios

In Code Conquest, learning is organized into "Concepts" - these are the programming topics you'll learn (like Variables, Data Types, etc.). Each Concept has multiple "Scenarios" (levels) that help you master that topic through different challenges.

For example, the "Variables & Data Types" Concept includes these Scenarios:

- Scenario #1: Integer Basics - Learn to use integer variables
- Scenario #2: Fibonacci Sequence - Practice with integers in a sequence
- Scenario #3: Floating Point Precision - Learn about decimal numbers
- Scenario #4: Boolean Trap Logic - Master true/false values
- And more...

Each Scenario is like a level with:

- A specific enemy to defeat
- Clear rules for how to attack
- Different ways to use the same concept
- Penalties for mistakes
- A unique challenge to solve

#### Why Multiple Scenarios?

Having multiple Scenarios for each Concept helps you:

- Practice the same idea in different ways
- Build a deeper understanding
- Learn from mistakes
- Master the concept thoroughly

For example, with Integers (Scenarios #1 and #2):

- Scenario #1 teaches basic integer usage
- Scenario #2 makes you use integers in a Fibonacci sequence
- Both use the same concept but in different ways

#### Level Types

1. **Learning Scenarios**
   - Introduce new programming concepts
   - Have clear rules and examples
   - Focus on one main idea
   - Example: Learning about integers in Scenario #1

2. **Practice Scenarios**
   - Help you master what you've learned
   - Give you different ways to use the concept
   - Example: Using integers in a sequence (Scenario #2)

3. **Challenge Scenarios**
   - Test your understanding
   - Combine multiple ideas
   - Have stricter rules
   - Example: Using different data types together

#### How Scenarios Work

Each Scenario has:

- An enemy with specific HP
- Your HP and base damage
- Clear objectives
- Rules for valid attacks
- Penalties for mistakes

For example, in Scenario #1 (Integer Basics):

- You fight the `NullInt` enemy
- You need to use integer variables correctly
- There are rules about valid attacks
- You get penalties for mistakes

#### Level Structure

- **Story Context**: Sets the scene and objectives
- **Unique Challenges**: Specific to the concept being taught
- **Entities**: Enemies or allies that interact with the code

#### Concept Progression

- **Introduction**: Basic concept explanation
- **Practice**: Hands-on application
- **Variation**: Different use cases
- **Advanced Usage**: Complex applications
- **Mastery**: Complete understanding

### 4. Feedback Systems

#### Code Analysis

- Real-time syntax checking
- Analyzer runs after 1.5 seconds of user inactivity
- No automatic code modification

#### Help System

- **Hints & Tips**
  - Syntax error suggestions
  - Inspired by Rust's Error ID system
- **Real-Time Error Messages**
  - Immediate feedback during tile connections
  - Guides players toward correct syntax

### 5. Progression Features

#### Battle Boosters

- **Player Resurrection**: Revives player if defeated
- **Syntax Shield**: Blocks damage from failed code runs

#### Enhanced Coding

- **Tile Compression**: Unlocks after concept mastery
  - Combines related tiles into single units
  - Speeds up code writing
  - Example: `if __name__ == "__main__":` as one tile

### 6. Analytics and Tracking
