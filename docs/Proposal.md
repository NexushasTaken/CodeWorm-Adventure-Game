# System Project Proposal

## CodeWorm: The Coding Adventure

### Description

CodeWorm: The Coding Adventure is a tile-based coding RPG that teaches programming fundamentals using Python through interactive challenges. Players connect code tiles to solve problems, unlock new programming concepts, and engage in turn-based combat with enemies. Each level introduces a new concept, such as variables, loops, or functions, encouraging players to practice and apply their Python skills in an engaging, story-driven format.

### Target Users

- Students are learning programming for the first time.
- Self-learners seeking a fun and structured way to learn coding.
- Educators are looking for an interactive tool to teach programming concepts.

### Target Deliverables

#### Tile-Based Coding Challenges

- Players use tiles representing programming keywords, syntax, and commands to construct code.
- A set level introduces a new concept (e.g., variables, loops, math operators), followed by coding challenges and problem-solving exercises to reinforce learning.
- Players progress by solving coding puzzles and facing enemies that test their understanding.

#### Feedback and Assistance

- Players receive feedback when running their code.
- Debugging assistance, such as hints and suggestions, helps players correct errors and improve their coding skills.
- A built-in error message system helps players understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Game Progression and Rewards

- Players earn achievements for mastering concepts, completing levels, and solving coding problems.
- Level completion is tracked, with performance analytics to help players what they have learned.
- Players can unlock skins as they progress, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

#### Entities (Enemies, Allies, and Bosses)

- Enemies: Each level has an enemy that represents a challenge related to the current programming concept.
- Allies: Some levels have allies that help teach programming concepts. These allies guide players through new concepts and provide them with tips or tutorials.
- Bosses: Boss battles occur when the player has to face complex coding challenges that combine many learned concepts (like algorithms or data structures). These bosses test the player's ability to apply knowledge to solve difficult problems.

### Integrated System: Cloud Service (Supabase)

This game integrates with Supabase, a cloud-based service that enhances the user experience by providing secure account management, progress tracking, and cross-device synchronization.

#### Implementation of Services

- Achievements & Milestones: Tracks progress through the game, awarding achievements for mastering programming concepts, completing levels, and solving challenges.
- Leaderboards: Ranks players based on performance, including speed, accuracy, and coding efficiency, encouraging friendly competition.
- Account Authentication: Players can securely create and manage accounts to save their progress, unlock features, and customize their experience.
- Data Sync: Ensures that player progress, achievements, and settings are synchronized across devices, preventing data loss and allowing players to continue seamlessly.
- Cross-Device Access: Players can log in on any device and continue where they left off, ensuring a smooth and flexible learning experience.
