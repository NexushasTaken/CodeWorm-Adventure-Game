# System Project Proposal

## CodeWorm: The Coding Adventure
### Description
CodeWorm: The Coding Adventure is an interactive game that aims to teach programming fundamentals through engaging tile-based coding challenges. Inspired by the popular game Bookworm, players connect tiles to form valid programming keywords, statements, or code snippets. Each level introduces a new programming concept, encouraging players to apply their knowledge to solve puzzles and progress through the game.

### Target Users
- Students learning programming for the first time.
- Self-learners seeking a structured method to learn coding.
- Educators in search of interactive tools to teach programming.
    
### Target Deliverables:
1. Tiled-Based Coding Challenges:
	- Players construct code snippets by connecting tiles with programming keywords, syntax, or commands (e.g., if, else, print, for, etc.).
	- Each level introduces new programming concepts, such as variables, loops, and functions; additionally, programming problems and questions for players to be able to retain what they have learned.
2. Multi-Language Support:
	- Players can select from various programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
	- The game adapts to the chosen language, offering relevant syntax and examples.
3. Interactive Learning Environment:
	- Real-time feedback on code execution.
	- Hints and tips to assist players with challenges.
4. Progress Tracking:
	- Players can monitor their progress through levels and concepts.
	- Summary reports on completed tasks and areas for improvement.
5. Game Concepts and Mechanics:
	- Time Challenges: Players complete coding tasks within a time limit.
	- Bonus Tiles: Special tiles (e.g., "debug" or "optimize") to provide extra points or hints.
	- Level Enemies and Allies: Each level can have enemies and allies that the player can face, enemies that test their understanding of what they have learned, and allies who teach the concepts.
	- Character Upgrade and Customization: Players can enhance their in-game character by upgrading equipment, unlocking new abilities, and customizing appearances.  
	- Equipment Upgrades: Players can improve their character’s tools, such as coding gloves, futuristic monitors, or AI assistants, which provide small benefits like faster challenge completion or minor hints.  
	- Skill Enhancements: Unlockable abilities grant advantages, such as temporary debugging assistance, faster code execution, or increased rewards for solving challenges efficiently.  
	- Character Customization: Players can personalize their avatars with different skins, outfits, and themes, allowing self-expression while progressing through the game.  
	- Boss Battle Boosts: Special upgrades help players defeat challenging level bosses more efficiently, such as temporary power-ups or enhanced coding speed. 

Integrated System: Supabase Service (Cloud-based)

This project integrates with Supabase Services, providing a structured gaming system that enhances user engagement, progress tracking, and cloud synchronization through achievements, leaderboards, and seamless cross-device access.

Implementation of Services:
1. Cloud-Based Game Data Sync: Synchronizes player progress, unlocked features, character upgrades, achievements, and level completions across multiple devices through Google Play Games' cloud system.
2. Achievements & Rewards: Tracks player milestones, awarding achievements for mastering programming concepts, completing levels, and solving coding challenges.
3. Leaderboards: Ranks players based on coding performance, fostering friendly competition and providing a measurable learning experience.
4. Google Play Sign-In: Enables secure authentication using Google accounts, ensuring data protection and eliminating the need for separate game credentials.
