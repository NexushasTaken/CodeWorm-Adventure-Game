## Why it's called Scenario instead of Level?

Naming them **Scenarios** instead of **Levels** suggests that each one is not just a stage or difficulty jump, but a **self-contained situation or coding challenge with narrative or context**. It fits your game concept better because:
- "Levels" imply generic progression.
- "Scenarios" feel like **missions or real coding situations**, especially in a game where the code and its analysis (errors, output) affect the turn-based battle.
- It makes sense for a programming-focused game. Each "Scenario" can teach or test specific concepts (e.g. Variables, Loops, Functions) in **contextual or story-driven form**.
- It matches how coding is usually practiced: you solve **problem scenarios**, not just "beat levels".
